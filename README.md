    <h1>MyMusic</h1>
    <h3>The best Discord.JS music selfbot.</h3>
</div>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Setup</h2>

1. Download [Bun](https://bun.sh) & clone the repo from Git.
2. Install dependencies: `bun i`.
3. Run the program to create the config file: `bun .`
4. Customize the newly created `.env` file.
   - The token must be a valid Discord account token.
   - You can allow specific IDs, or `*` for everyone.
   - You can also block specific people. This blocklist will override `*` on allow.
5. If you want to customize what the bot says, edit `strings.js`. It's already set up if you don't want to bother it.
6. Run `bun .` again to start the bot!
